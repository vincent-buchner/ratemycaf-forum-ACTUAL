                    <p>
                        I started working on Rate My Caf when I was on spring break this year; during this
                        time I was able to learn React. React is a new web development framework that is becoming increasingly 
                        popular. I was really excited to learn it, as it would allow me to work with a newer and more up-to-date 
                        technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I was thinking of how to code Rate My Caf, I knew that I would need to make it more interactive, hence which is why I learn React.
                        I had never coded anything like this before, so it was a learning process for me. I found some helpful tutorials online,
                        and I also asked my friends for advice. In the end, I was able to create a basic Rate My Caf page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My next step was to add the features I wanted. I wanted to be able to add photos, 
                        the ratings obviously, and some simple graphs. I found a npm package that simplified the process of making graphs and charts,
                        so that was fairly easy. I was also able to make the responses from the Google Form connect with the website and display the data,
                        but I had some trouble with the form features. I didn't understand how to add the fields, and I ended up misspelling some of the text fields. 
                        I eventually figured it out, but it wasn't easy.
