                    <p class="lead"><i>The Explanation</i></p>
                    <p>
                        When "Rate My Caf" was first launch, it didn't have much of a following by any means. It was a very small app that I showed
                        a couple of friends, toyed around with, and learned from. Sure, I wanted it expand and grow in users, but during the the first 
                        couple days I wanted to just test it. Building full stack applications is still relatively new to me, so I wanted to make sure everything
                        ran smoothly. And for the most part, it got good feedback besides to a couple of UI changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>And that's when it got taken down.</p>
                    <p>
                        At first I was frustrated, not because I thought it got taken down, but because earlier that week I was have trouble 
                        connecting the domain to the actual website which was infuriating. But when I realized that it wasn't on my end and that Luther
                        had actually taken it down, I was scared shitless. I thought the Luther ITS team was going to bust through my dorm door, through 
                        a bag over my head, and take me out to a rural corn field outside of Decorah and have me whacked. Obviously I'm joking, but nonetheless
                        it was a bit anxious that I had done something wrong. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this quick 15 seconds of panic and horror was almost immediately diminished when I started to take a little pride 
                        in its removal. After all, Luther College has officially acknowledged <i>my website</i>. I thought it was kinda cool. Granted 
                        I made the website for Luther students and staff to use, so then it was time to try and get it back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was probably the hardest part; getting in touch with the Luther Networking Team and ITS. It took about three weeks before I even
                        a response back from either party, but once I finally got an email back I was asked to meet with the head of Dining Services.
                        And that went really well! I walked them through the app and they seemed to have enjoyed it! Overall, it worked out really well and now
                        the app is back up!
