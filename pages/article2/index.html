                    <p class="lead"><i>The Origin</i></p>
                    <p>
                        Rate My Caf was started by a small group of friends walking to the 
                        cafeteria after school. The food wasn't too great and we were just joking 
                        around about having a local food rating platform. Somehow, the idea just grew and turned into a full-fledged web app. 
                        We started rating the food and the response was amazing. 
                        People loved the idea of being able to rate the food they were eating, 
                        and we saw it having a future so we decided to keep it up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rate My Caf is actually quite simple. Students and staff rate the food and then those responses get compiled the 
                        results into an easily understandable score. We also provide ratings for different 
                        types of food, so that people can get a better idea of what they should be eating. We want 
                        people to be able to make smarter choices about the food they eat, and Rate My Caf is the 
                        perfect way to do that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rate My Caf is a great way for people to get information about the food they are eating. 
                        It is also a fun way to joke around with friends. We are working hard to make food rating 
                        as easy as possible, so that everyone can benefit from the information we provide.
