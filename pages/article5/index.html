                        First things first, I still hold the intentions of growing "Rate My Caf". I'm currently working on improving some of the 
                        frontend features and make a better backend. There's still a lot to do in terms of improvements. Eventually, I'd to make a profit
                        off Rate My Caf by putting ads on it. But I'm not sure we're at that stage yet.
                    </p>

                        In the future, I would like to develop a shopping app that has a fast-paced feel to it and a quick satisfaction aspect. 
                        This app would allow users to shop for products quickly and easily without having to go through 
                        long checkout processes or wait on long lines. The app would also feature automatic inventory updates so 
                        customers always know what items are in stock.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like I said, the app would have a very fast paced feel to it. In fact, I would like it to feel as if you are literally shopping in the blink of an eye. 
                        This means that once you purchase something, you could just check it out and it'd come to your door in a matter of days. I would also like to include social 
                        media integration so that you can share your purchases with your friends and followers.
                    </p>

                        But enable for me to pursue either of those paths, I need to find internships in those areas. I'm not sure 
                        how I'm going to do that, but I'll figure it out. I need to develop some skills in order to pursue either 
                        of those paths, and internships will give me the opportunity to do that. I'm still not sure which skills 
                        I'll need for those positions, but I'll research more into that as well. Overall, I'm going to continue 
                        thinking about what I want to do, and I'll research into different aspects of those areas to see what 
                        opportunities are available to me.
